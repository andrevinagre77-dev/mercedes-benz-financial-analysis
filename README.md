**Advanced Financial Data Analytics | Full-Cycle Investment Strategy**

## 💎 Business Impact Summary
This project demonstrates a high-precision financial analysis of the Mercedes-Benz Group (MBG.DE) during a period of extreme market volatility (2020-2022). By leveraging Python-driven data science, I identified a strategic entry point during a market correction and timed a liquidation at the cyclical peak, resulting in top-tier capital appreciation.

### 🚀 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Return on Investment (ROI):** **+345%** absolute growth.
* **Capital Multiplier:** **4.6x** initial equity deployment.
* **Net Realized Profit:** **€3,456.50** (based on a standard €1,000 position).
* **Alpha Generation:** Outperformed sector benchmarks through data-driven timing.

## 🎯 Executive Execution Strategy

### 1. Strategic Entry (The "Buy" Signal)
* **Execution Price:** €17.48 (March 2020).
* **Analysis:** Identified a historical support level during the global market sell-off. The technical indicators suggested an asymmetric risk-reward ratio, providing a safe but highly profitable entry window.

### 2. Strategic Exit (The "Profit-Take" Signal)
* **Execution Price:** €77.90 (February 2022).
* **Analysis:** Captured the peak of the automotive sector recovery. Liquidation was executed prior to the 2022 inflationary correction, preserving maximum capital gains.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation (The "Engine")
To achieve these results, I developed an automated pipeline in Python:

* **Data Wrangling:** Processing historical OHLCV data using `Pandas`.
* **Financial Visualization:** Custom `Matplotlib` dashboards for price delta and capital accumulation tracking.
* **Dividend Integration:** Analysis of `Adj Close` to account for total shareholder return (TSR).
* **AI-Optimized Code:** Implementation of efficient algorithms for real-time portfolio performance auditing.
